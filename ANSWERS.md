- [1] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)

  1. Class components have access to lifecycle methods whereas before hooks funtions did not! Made it difficult to handle non-visual data

- [2] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  2. Constructor - allows you to pass props and initalize your state
  3. Render - Returns the JSX of your componenet and compiles
  4. ComponentDidMount - allows us to load data or events

- [3] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

  3. Custom Hooks allows us to reuse stateful logic that can save repeated code and increase readability

- [4] Why is it important to test our apps?

  4. Testing our apps ensures that when we make changes to components or functions within we are still rendering or receiving the data we want to display. Reduces debugging time and trial by error methods.
